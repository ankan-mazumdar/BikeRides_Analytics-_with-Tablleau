 "Data Analytics Project Using Python and SQL: Clean, Load, Analyze, and Solve Questions from Kaggle API Dataset"

End to end data analytics project using Python and SQL.
- Using kaggle API to download dataset and cleaning data in pandas.
- Loading data into SQL server and solving SQL questions based on the data.

Downloading and setting up the dataset in SQL plus Python
- Obtaining the link of the dataset and using the kaggle API for downloading
- Setting up Anaconda Navigator and Jupyter notebook for Python work and executing required commands

Fixing unknown and not available values in ship mode column
- Identify distinct values in the ship mode column
- Use Na values option in Pandas to treat 'unknown' and 'not available' as null

An alternative method of renaming columns in a DataFrame is discussed
- Using 'DF.rename' method with a JSON to specify renaming columns individually
- Instead of passing all 15 columns individually, extract all columns, convert to lower case, and replace spaces with underscores

Convert 'order date' column to date format
- Using pandas' to_datetime method to convert 'order date' column to date format with specified format YYmmdd
- Ensure the converted column shows data type as 'datetime' by assigning it back to the original data set

Dropping unnecessary columns from the dataset
- Using the 'inplace=True' argument in Pandas to drop columns from the dataset without returning anything
- Preparing to load the cleaned data into SQL Server using SQL Alchemy

Creating and modifying data analytics tables using Python and SQL.
- The process of creating a table with appropriate data types and appending data to it.
- Addressing issues with data types and the best practices for modifying tables.

Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process with Python and SQL
- Creating a table and loading data using 'append' command instead of 'replace'
- Discussing data types, primary key, and loading data into SQL Server

Ranking and grouping data by region and product ID
- Using Group by and Order by to sort data by reason and sales
- Generating rank for top 5 products in each reason using window functions

Extracting top five products by sales for different regions
- The query retrieves top five products by sales for Central, East, South, and West regions
- Utilizing year and month data for 2022 and 2023 to perform a month-over-month sales growth comparison

Aggregate and sum data by month to get one row for each month
- Group by month and year to aggregate sales data
- Determine month with highest sales for each category by year month format

Formatting date in YYmm for data analysis
- Formatting date as YYmm for easy data aggregation
- Performing data aggregation by order month and year, summing sales by category

Calculating growth percentage for sales data.
- Using the formula - (sales of 2023 - sales of 2022) / sales of 2022 * 100.
- Applying the growth percentage in order by filtering for highest growth subcategory.

Building a data analytics project using Python and SQL
- Using Python to extract and analyze data
- Using SQL to query and manipulate the data
